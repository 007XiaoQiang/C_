# A Compiler Writing Journey

In this Github repository, I'm documenting my journey to write a
self-compiling compiler. I'm also writing out the details so that,
if you want to follow along, there will be an explanation of what
I did, why, and with some references back to the theory of compilers.

But not too much theory, I want this to be a practical journey.

Here are the steps I've taken so far:

 + [Part  0](00_Introduction/Readme.md):  Introduction to the Journey
 + [Part  1](01_Scanner/Readme.md):       Introduction to Lexical Scanning
 + [Part  2](02_Parser/Readme.md):        Introduction to Parsing
 + [Part  3](03_Precedence/Readme.md):    Operator Precedence
 + [Part  4](04_Assembly/Readme.md):      An Actual Compiler
 + [Part  5](05_Statements/Readme.md):    Statements
 + [Part  6](06_Variables/Readme.md):     Variables
 + [Part  7](07_Comparisons/Readme.md):   Comparison Operators
 + [Part  8](08_If_Statements/Readme.md): If Statements
 + [Part  9](09_While_Loops/Readme.md):   While Loops
 + [Part 10](10_For_Loops/Readme.md):     For Loops
 + [Part 11](11_Functions_pt1/Readme.md): Functions, part 1
 + [Part 12](12_Types_pt1/Readme.md):     Types, part 1
 + [Part 13](13_Functions_pt2/Readme.md): Functions, part 2
 + [Part 14](14_ARM_Platform/Readme.md):  Generating ARM Assembly Code
 + [Part 15](15_Pointers_pt1/Readme.md):  Pointers, part 1
 + [Part 16](16_Global_vars/Readme.md):   Declaring Global Variables Properly

There isn't a schedule or timeline for the future parts, so
just keep checking back here to see if I've written any more.

## Copyrights

I have borrowed some of the code, and lots of ideas, from the 
[SubC](http://www.t3x.org/subc/) compiler written by Nils M Holm.
His code is in the public domain. I think that my code is substantially
different enough that I can apply a different license to my code.

Unless otherwise noted,

   the GPL3 license.
 + all non-source code documents (e.g. English documents,
   image files) are (c) Warren Toomey under the Creative
   Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
